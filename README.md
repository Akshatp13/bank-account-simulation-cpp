# Bank Account Simulation (C++)

This is a **very basic bank account simulation** written in **C++**.  
It is my **first ever project**, created to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and basic **DSA concepts** while learning C++.

## 🚀 Features
- Create bank accounts
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money with PIN verification
- Check account balance
- Change account PIN
- Transfer funds between accounts
- Display account details
- Close account (basic simulation)

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Constructors
- Member functions
- Basic input/output
- References (for fund transfer)

## 📌 Note
This project is **very basic** and made for **learning purposes only**.  
It does **not** represent a real banking system and does not include advanced security or data storage.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
